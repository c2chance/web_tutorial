This guide walks you through the process of creating a Spring application connected to a MySQL Database (as opposed to an in-memory, embedded database, which most of the other guides and many sample applications use). It uses Spring Data JPA to access the database, but this is only one of many possible choices (for example, you could use plain Spring JDBC).
